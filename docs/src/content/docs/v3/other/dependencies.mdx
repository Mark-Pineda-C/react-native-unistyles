Unistyles 3.0 minimizes dependencies to keep your app as lightweight as possible.
In the latest version, we’ve opted to include only two essential dependencies that are shaping the future of the React Native ecosystem.

### Nitro Modules

Developed by: [Marc Rousavy](https://github.com/mrousavy)

[Nitro modules](https://nitro.margelo.com/) help Unistyles speed up development time by offering remarkable solutions:
- Type-safe interfaces across multiple languages (`TypeScript`, `C++`, `Swift`, and `Kotlin`)
- Generating bindings from a single source of truth (specification files)
- A thin layer that accelerates calls from `JavaScript` to `C++`, `Swift`, or `Kotlin`
- The ability to convert repository from Objective-C to Swift
- Support for calling Swift code directly, without routing it through Objective-C++

We highly encourage you to give Nitro a start ⭐ or support Marc through sponsorship.

### React Native Edge to Edge

Developed by: [Mathieu Acthernoene](https://github.com/zoontek)

[React Native Edge to Edge](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-edge-to-edge) is a library aimed at unifying the handling of edge-to-edge layouts on Android.
We fully support this initiative and have made it a dependency for Unistyles.

You likely won’t notice any changes, as Unistyles has enforced edge-to-edge layouts since version 2.8.0. However, other libraries that detect `react-native-edge-to-edge` can now reliably assume that this mode is enabled.
Additionally, Mathieu's initiative is supported by [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), which suggests it may become a standard in the future.

If you use any of Mathieu's libraries, such as `react-native-permissions` or `react-native-bootsplash`, we encourage you to give them a star ⭐ and support him through sponsorship.
