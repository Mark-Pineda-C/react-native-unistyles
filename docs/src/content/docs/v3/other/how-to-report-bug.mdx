While developing with Unistyles, you might encounter one of several bug types. Before submitting a bug report, please ensure that you include the required information listed below.

<Aside type="caution" title="Before submitting a bug report">
We highly encourage you to create a small reproduction of the bug. Without it, we might not be able to assist, and the issue could become stale.
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Crashes (eg. BAD ACCESS)

    Unistyles relies heavily on C++ code, which may throw exceptions. If you encounter a crash, please attach a log that points to the exact line of code where the crash occurred. Use Logcat in Android Studio or Xcode logs to capture this information. Additionally, providing code snippets or a reproduction of the bug is highly helpful.

2. View is not updating

    This issue could be caused by:
     - A bug in the `C++` parser
     - A bug in the Babel plugin

     To isolate the issue, update your `babel.config.js` file and enable `debug` mode:

      ```js title="babel.config.js"
      module.exports = function (api) {
        api.cache(true)

        return {
          plugins: [
              ['react-native-unistyles/plugin', {
                  debug: true
              }]
          ]
        }
      }
      ```

      Then, run your app with a cleared cache:

      ```shell
      yarn start --reset-cache
      ```

     In the console, verify if the component reports the correct dependencies for the style associated with the component that isnâ€™t updating.

     - If dependencies are correct, use `console.log` to inspect the style and attempt to re-render the component (e.g., via reloading or a state update)
     - If the logged style is correct (even after re-render), the issue is likely in the C++ core. Please provide as many details as possible for further assistance

3. Immediate crash before rendering a view with cryptic errors like `path[0] is not defined`

    This is likely a Babel plugin issue. Isolate the StyleSheet or style syntax causing the problem and share it with us. We will prioritize patching it.


4. Discrepancies between iOS, Android and Web parser

   The web uses a custom parser that may produce different results compared to iOS and Android. We're exploring the use of `WebAssembly` to share C++ parser across platforms.
