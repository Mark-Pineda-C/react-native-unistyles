In order to use more features and tailor Unistyles to your needs, you need to configure it. Unistyles config has been divided into three parts:

1. Themes
2. Breakpoints
3. Settings

### Themes (optional)

`Themes` is a JavaScript object where keys are unique theme names and values are actual themes. To learn more about themes, check out [theming](/todo) guide.

```tsx title="unistyles.ts"
const lightTheme = {
    colors: {
        primary: '#ff1ff4',
        secondary: '#1ff4ff'
        // any nesting, spreading, arrays, etc.
    },
    // functions, external imports, etc.
    gap: (v: number) => v * 8
}

const otherTheme = {
    colors: {
        primary: '#aa12ff',
        secondary: 'pink'
    },
    gap: (v: number) => v * 8
}

const appThemes = {
    light: lightTheme,
    other: otherTheme
}
```

<Aside>
Unistyles supports any dynamic theme and doesn't enforce any specific structure. To prevent TypeScript issues make sure that every theme has the same structure (type).
</Aside>

### Breakpoints (optional)

`Breakpoints` is also a JavaScript object where keys are unique breakpoint names and values are actual breakpoints values (numbers). You should make sure that you register at least one breakpoint with value 0 as it's necessary to simulate CSS media queries cascading.

```tsx title="unistyles.ts"
const breakpoints = {
    xs: 0, // <-- make sure to register at least one breakpoint with value 0
    sm: 300,
    md: 500,
    lg: 800,
    xl: 1200
    // use as many breakpoints as you need
}
```

### Settings (optional)

`Settings` object was simplified at in the most recent version supports only two properties:

- `adaptiveThemes` - boolean, enables or disables adaptive themes [learn more](/todo)
- `initialTheme` - string, or synchronous function that sets initial theme

```tsx title="unistyles.ts"
const settings = {
    adaptiveThemes: true,
    initialTheme: 'light'
}
```

### TypeScript (optional)

If your repository is using TypeScript is highly recommended to override library types to get perfect autocomplete and type safety about your themes and breakpoints:

```tsx title="unistyles.ts"
type AppThemes = typeof appThemes
type AppBreakpoints = typeof breakpoints

declare module 'react-native-unistyles' {
    export interface UnistylesThemes extends AppThemes {}
    export interface UnistylesBreakpoints extends AppBreakpoints {}
}

```

### Set configuration

The final piece of configuration is to set all the configs by calling `StyleSheet.configure` function:

```tsx title="unistyles.ts"
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

StyleSheet.configure({
    themes: appThemes,
    breakpoints,
    settings
})

```

That's it! Now you can use Unistyles in your project!

### Full example

```tsx title="unistyles.ts"
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const lightTheme = {
    colors: {
        primary: '#ff1ff4',
        secondary: '#1ff4ff'
    },
    gap: (v: number) => v * 8
}

const otherTheme = {
    colors: {
        primary: '#aa12ff',
        secondary: 'pink'
    },
    gap: (v: number) => v * 8
}

const appThemes = {
    light: lightTheme,
    other: otherTheme
}

const breakpoints = {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 300,
    md: 500,
    lg: 800,
    xl: 1200
}

type AppBreakpoints = typeof breakpoints
type AppThemes = typeof appThemes

declare module 'react-native-unistyles' {
    export interface UnistylesThemes extends AppThemes {}
    export interface UnistylesBreakpoints extends AppBreakpoints {}
}

StyleSheet.configure({
    settings: {
        initialTheme: 'light',
    },
    breakpoints,
    themes: {
        light: lightTheme,
        other: otherTheme
    }
})

```

<Aside>
Don't forget to import this config somewhere in your project, for example in `index.ts` file.
