---

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Unistyles is primarily written in C++ with a thin JS layer for both iOS and Android. The key feature of this version is that it doesn’t re-render your components—there are no hooks, no context, just pure JSI bindings managing your `StyleSheet` styles.

Unistyles is integrated with Fabric and the Shadow Tree, updating your views directly from C++. This is why it’s not feasible to backport it to the old architecture.
