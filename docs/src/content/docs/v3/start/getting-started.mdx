import { Card, CardGrid, Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

We put a lot of effort into making Unistyles as easy to use as possible. That's why you no longer need to use `useStyle` hook or wrap your app in any provider. Unistyles works inline with your existing code, so you can use it right away.

### Prerequisites

Unistyles 3.0 is tightly integrated with `Fabric` and most recent version of React Native. That's why you need to use **New Architecture** and at least **React Native 0.76.0**. Additionally Unistyles depends on `react-native-nitro-modules` and `react-native-edge-to-edge`.

<Aside>Learn more on how Unistyles is using Nitro modules and React Native Edge to Edge [here](/todo).</Aside>


|  | Version | Note |
| -------- | ------- | ---- |
| React Native | 0.76+     |     |
| New Architecture    | enabled     | no option to opt-out   |
| Expo SDK    | 52+     | (if you use Expo)    |
| Xcode    | 16+     | Required by Nitro Modules    |

Due to the fact that Unistyles is using `Fabric`, it's not possible to run it on `Old Architecture` nor older versions of React Native. If you're not able to meet this requirements, you can use Unistyles 2.0+ which is compatible with those versions.

### Installation

```shell title="shell"
yarn add react-native-unistyles@next
yarn add react-native-nitro-modules react-native-edge-to-edge
```

Add babel plugin:

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)

  return {
    // other config
    plugins: [
        // other plugins
        ['react-native-unistyles/plugin']
    ]
  }
}
```

Finish installation based on your platform:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Expo">
    ```shell
    yarn expo prebuild --clean
    ```
    <Aside type="caution" title="Dev client only">
      Unistyles includes custom native code, which means it does not support **Expo Go.**
    </Aside>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="React Native">
    ```shell
    cd ios && pod install
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="React Native Web">
    Unistyles offers first-class support for React Native Web. To run the project, we recommend following the guidelines provided by [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/).

### As easy as React Native StyleSheet

Getting started with Unistyles couldn't been easier. All you need to do is to replace React Native `StyleSheet` with `StyleSheet` exported from Unistyles. From now on you're using `StyleSheet` with superpowers 🦸🏼‍♂️.

```diff lang="tsx" title="Example.tsx"
- import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
+ import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello world from Unistyles</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
   container: {
     backgroundColor: 'red'
   }
})
```

By replacing StyleSheets you already have some benefits that are not avaiable in React Native StyleSheet:

- [Variants](/todo)
- [Compound variants](/todo)
- [Dynamic styles](/todo)
- [Media queries](/todo)
- [Horizontal and vertical breakpoints for Native](/todo)
- [Custom web styles](/todo)
- [Custom web classes](/todo)

When you're ready to customize your styles and enable more features you can [configure](/) Unistyles.
