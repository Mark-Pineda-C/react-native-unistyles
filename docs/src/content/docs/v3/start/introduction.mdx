Unistyles is a cross-platform library that enables you to share up to 100% of your styles across all platforms.
It combines the simplicity of `StyleSheet` with the performance of `C++`.

**`Unistyles` is a superset of `StyleSheet`** similar to how `TypeScript` is a superset of `JavaScript`.
If you're familiar with styling in React Native, then you already know how to use `Unistyles`.

<Card title="Why should you use Unistyles?">
- it guarantees no re-renders across entire app (there are no hooks, no context, just pure JSI bindings)
- it doesn't pollute your native view hierarchy (Unistyles has no component wrappers)
- it has cross-platform parser written in C++, so you can expect same output on all platforms
- it uses [Nitro Modules](https://nitro.margelo.com/) under the hood (everything is strongly typed!)
- transforms your `StyleSheets` into `StyleSheets` with superpowers ü¶∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÇ that can access themes, platform specific values and more!Ô∏è
- loved by developers from all over the world, 1.1M+ downloads and more than 1.5K+ stars on GitHub
